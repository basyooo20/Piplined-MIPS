# Piplined-MIPS
a Pipelined 32-Bit MIPS Micro-Processor (RISC-Like Harvard Architecture), Using Verilog HDL. It has early branch prediction and a hazard control unit that deals with data and control hazards by forwarding, stalling and flushing. 

I followed the design in the reference "Digital design and computer architecture" and I extended the design to handle the addi and j instructions.

To test the design the processor is simulated on ModelSim tool.

I ran the following programs:

-Get greatest common divisor between 120 and 180.
-Get the factorial of 7.
-Get the Fibonacci sequence.
